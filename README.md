# Gesture-Control-with-Real-Time-Audio-Visualizations
This project is a Python application that combines gesture recognition and real-time audio visualization. It uses a webcam to detect hand gestures and controls the system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger. Additionally, it visualizes audio data in real-time using various visual effects.
